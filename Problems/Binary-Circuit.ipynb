    "An engineer is building a circuit that processes binary strings. A binary string can be segregated by moving all Is to the end of the string. For example, \"01010\" becomes \"00011\" after segregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a single operation, a T can be moved to the right until it reaches the end of the string or another 1. The cost of the operation is 1 plus the number of places the T is moved. Each T must be moved to its maximum possible position to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a binary string s, find the maximum possible cost to segregate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "s = \"110100\"\n",
    "â€¢ The optimal strategy to maximize cost:\n",
    "1. Swap the second and third characters at a cost of 2, resulting in \"101100\"\n",
    "2. Swap the first and second characters at a cost of 2, resulting in \"011100\"\n",
    "3. Move each T to the end (moving 2 places each) at a cost of 3 per move\n",
    "The total cost is 2 + 2 + (3 x 3) = 13.\n",
    "Function Description\n",
    "Complete the function getMaxCost in the editor with the following parameters:\n",
    "string s; a binary string\n",
    "Returns\n",
    "long int: the maximum possible cost to segregate the string"
