    "So first it gets all of the points and formats them in integers so they are easier to work with. Next python sorts them with .sorted(). Next I get the minutes from 0 to the time it is so 0 would be 0 01:00 would be 60. Next I loop through and check the min distance from each of the points. Lastly I check the distance from the front one to the back one. "
